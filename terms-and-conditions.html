                      effort toward providing guidelines to the Product Owner’s
                      in respect of generating an invoice. However, in the

                      User must enter their preferred mode of payment and
                      shipping company. As KGK Online Jewels cannot estimate the
                      amount of time taken for the product to be delivered, we
                      cannot guarantee a specific delivery timeframe for any
                      items and therefore, a Registered User is not permitted to
                      cancel the purchase if the product(s) does not ship from
                      the Product Owner within a reasonable timeframe. If the
                      Registered User does not receive a product(s) within the
                      timeframe specified in the confirmation email, a
                      Registered User shall promptly report the issue on the
                      Website within 7 days of the latest estimated delivery
                      date. KGK Jewels Online has the right, in our sole and
                      absolute discretion to refuse to accept returns or other
                      refunds and/or to charge restocking fees for returned or
